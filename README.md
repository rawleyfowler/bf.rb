# bf.rb
A small, semi portable BrainF\*\*k implementation in Ruby. I have been meaning to write a BrainF**k interpreter for a long time so I decided to challenge myself to write it as fast as possible.

This project took me, 2 hours (50% of it trying to understand BrainF**k). I learned a lot about Ruby while writing this so I hope others can find it as a useful reference!
